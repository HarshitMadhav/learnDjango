1 -> install python

2 -> To create a virtual environment for your project, open a new command prompt, navigate to the folder where 
you want to create your project and then enter the following:
     py -m venv project-name

3 -> This will create a folder called ‘project-name’ if it does not already exist and setup the virtual environment. To activate the environment, run:
     project-name\Scripts\activate.bat

4 -> The virtual environment will be activated and you’ll see “(project-name)” next to the command prompt to designate that.
Each time you start a new command prompt, you’ll need to activate the environment again.

5 -> Install Django 
Django can be installed easily using pip within your virtual environment.
In the command prompt, ensure your virtual environment is active, and execute the following command:
     py -m pip install Django

6-> This will download and install the latest Django release.
After the installation has completed, you can verify your Django installation by executing django-admin --version in the command prompt.
